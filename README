This bus management system was written as a solution to the problem outlined here: https://gist.github.com/mnoack/6e4b66d5a8da1a73abd5

These are some of my thoughts when designing it.
Planning:
Arrays for:
busses - array of bus objects where the key that identifies them is the bus id
lines - array of line objects that are identified by the line nubmer
routes - array of route objects that are identified by the route name
stops - array of strings that are identified by an autoincrementing key

I have decided to perform the following tests in order to ensure the system fulfils the brief:
Create several stops
Create several routes
Create several lines
Create a bus, assign it to a line and set the schedule
Change the schedule the bus is on
Change the line the bus is on
Remove the bus from the system

I will need to retieve and output the data throughout the steps above, to make sure that the system is working as designed.


I made some assumptions during this process:
That the busses have an id.
There is no other information about a stop than it's code - if there is, then it should also be an object.
There is no other information about a time schedule than that it is the time that a bus arrives at it's first stop.
